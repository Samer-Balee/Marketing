# About the project

## Description

A Marketing Agency website needs to refactor to make it more accessible and a codebase that follows accessibility standards SO their own site is optimized for search engines.

We got a starter code that needs to refactor by:

1- Add a semantic HTML elements so that when we view the structure of the HTML elements we find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.

2- Add accessible alt attributes for the images.

3- Consolidate and organize CSS selectors and properties to follow semantic structure.

4- Adding comments to CSS file.
